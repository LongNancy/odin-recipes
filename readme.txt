This is going to be my first project for The Odin Project. It is a basic recipe blog. 
For this beginning project all I will need is HTML but I am under the assumption that I will eventually add CSS to it as well. 

Touch index.html
Git remote -v.  Dude where's my car



Git status 

Git clone _clones your repo to GitHub 
Git add file name to add it to the staging area
Git commit -m
Git log

Git push origin main - this pushes the project back up to GitHub
