    <h2>Sometimes the most simple recipe is the best policy</h2>
    <p>Ice cream is great for those hot summers. This recipe is wildly simple but I think you'll find that it has better flavor than a lot of the options on the market.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Milk</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup  sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl until the sugar is fully dissolved</li>
            <li>Add the mixture to an ice cream mixture until it's the consistency of soft serve.</li>
            <li>Quickly move contents to a tupperware and put in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>For easier scooping, leave on the counter for five minutes or so and run the scooper under the hot tap.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>*Goes great with homemade chocolate sauce. 1c sugar, 1/4c dark cocoa, 3/4c water simmered on the stove finished with a tsp of vanilla extract, cooled and bottled. </p>
