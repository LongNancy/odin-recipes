    <h2>Macaroni and cheese can be as easy or involved as you want to make it.</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese is a staple in any diet as it provides carbs and dairy 
        as well as protein when chicken or hot dogs are added. Pork or beef hot dogs make a great addition to any stovetop macaroni and cheese.</p>
        <p>You'll also see in this recipe that it uses a roux base. Making a roux is a basic kitchen skill that can be applied in a wide variety of recipes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Milk</li>
        <li>4 Tbls Flour</li>
        <li>4 Tbls Butter</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Salt, Pepper, Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cups Sharp Cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>3      Hot Dogs, chopped</li>
        <br/>
        <li>4 cups Cooked Elbow Noodled</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the roux by cooking the butter and flour together until fragrant and then add the milk one dollop at a time mixing the whole time until all is combined without clumps.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese and let it melt into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the hot dogs and let it stew for a couple of minutes on low to help spread the flavor.</li>
            <li>Add spices to your taste before adding the cooked macaroni.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>*It should be noted that you should always cook your pasta in salted water. It should be as briney as the sea!</p>
        <p>**It should also be noted that I cook this dish by eyeing the ingredients as I've been making it for years. The amounts listed here are arbitrary but in the ballpark of correct.</p>
